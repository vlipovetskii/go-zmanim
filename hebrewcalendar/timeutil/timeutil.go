		--- Why Was UTC Created When There Was GMT? https://www.worldtimeserver.com/learn/why-was-utc-created-when-there-was-gmt/\
		- UTC vs. GMT
		UTC is not a time zone, while GMT is.
		Although there was GMT, a committee at the United Nations officially adopted UTC as a standard. This is because it is more accurate than GMT for setting clocks.
		Coordinated Universal Time and Greenwich Mean Time is used interchangeably;
		thatâ€™s why knowing their difference is a must, especially when dealing with time.
		They might be confusing, but all you need to remember is that UTC is the current standard time used as a reference for other time zones.
